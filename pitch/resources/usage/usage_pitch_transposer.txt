-------------------------- Pitch transposer v1.0 ---------------------------
Usage: cargo run --bin pitch_transposer -- algo in shift [fsize sframes]
  - a:   the selected algorithm, 0 for phase vocoder, 1 for basic transposer
  - in:  the path to the .wav file to transform.
  - s:   the scale factor, a real number strictly superior to 0. In order to
         shift by semitons, use this formula s = 2^(semitons / 12).
  - fs:  the frame size to use, mandatory for the phase vocoder (a=0).
  - sf:  the shift between frames, mandatory for the phase vocoder (a=0).
  
Output files are stored in `resources/outputs/`.
