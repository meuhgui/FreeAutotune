------------------------ Quality checker v1.0 ------------------------
Usage: cargo run --bin quality_checker -- ps po th
  - ps: the path to the signal to check
  - po: the path to the "oracle" signal (i.e the reference)
  - th: the threshold value of the distance between the oracle and the
        signal (a float number that holds on 32 bits)

The output is printed to standard output and it displays the following
elements separated by a blank space: `ps po th c d`,  where ps po and
th are the arguments provided to the binary and:
   - c: 1 if the euclidian distance between the oracle and the signal
        is inferior or equal to the threshold, 0 otherwise
   - d: a real number representing the euclidian distance between the
        oracle and the signal
